# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jack!

**NOW:** Senior Platform Engineer @ Kraken for almost 3 years, working with AWS & k8s to make a greener world.

**PREVIOUSLY**: 6+ years of experience in Software Engineering teams, most recently working on building internal, common services, and CICD tools for teams to consume, and helping teams deliver and deploy secure containers in to. Previous experience as a software engineer has exposed me to a huge cross-section of technologies, languages, and practices, and my current DevOps role has also involved incorporating and establishing various basic SRE practises. I greatly enjoy creating just-about-everything-as-code using things like Terraform, Packer, Ansible, Pulumi, and Helm, to name but a few. I'm also a huge proponent of GitOps, and will take any opportunity to convert people.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying for the AWS Advanced Networking cert

- âš¡ Fun fact: I can learn, and then subsequently unlearn RegEx within a matter of seconds, and tend to perform this trick the minute I need to know it.
