# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jack!

**NOW:** Senior Platform Engineer @ Kraken for the last 3 years, building out and managing the AWS platform that hosts our workloads to make a greener world.

**PREVIOUSLY**: 6+ years of experience in Software Engineering teams, working on building internal common services and CICD tools for teams to consume, and helping teams deliver and deploy secure containers in to a Kubernetes environment. Previous experience as a software engineer has exposed me to a huge cross-section of technologies, languages, and practices, and my current DevOps role has also involved incorporating and establishing various SRE and FinOps practises. I greatly enjoy creating just-about-everything-as-code using tools like Terraform, CDK/CloudFormation, Packer, Ansible, Pulumi, and Helm, to name but a few. I'm also a huge proponent of GitOps, and an early adopter/champion of ArgoCD.

- ðŸ”­ Currently working at Kraken
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying for the AWS Advanced Networking certificate
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Raise a PR! 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can learn, and then subsequently unlearn RegEx within a matter of seconds, and tend to perform this trick the minute I need to know it.
